# Samsung Anti-Theft Tracker Web App (Ghost-Hardened)

A standalone, React-based web application containing an interactive, mathematically optimized checklist for repurposing old Samsung devices into hyper-stealthy, off-grid anti-theft car tracking beacons.

## Current Features
*   **Dual-Network Beaconing:** Leverages both **Samsung Find** and **Google Find My Device** (with "Everywhere" network settings) for maximum recovery reach.
*   **Ghost Hardening:** Granular steps for disabling system alerts, silencing tracking notifications, and stripping the UI to zero-visibility.
*   **Dynamic SIM Toggles:** Seamlessly switch between "No SIM (Offline)" and "With SIM (Full Features)" modes.
*   **Geofence Tripwires:** Intelligent "Modes & Routines" for "Home" and "Work" that automatically kill Wi-Fi and engage power-saving the moment a vehicle is moved.
*   **Expert Data Security:** Guidance on "Account Isolation," "Contact Handshake scrubbing," and "Death Gasp" location pings.
*   **Hardware Protection:** Strategies for battery longevity and thermal safety in permanent vehicle-mount scenarios.

## 🚀 Future Development Roadmap
1. **Automated Settings Audit:** Continuous refinement of One UI 8.0/Android 16 obscure settings.
2. **Native Automation:** ADB/MDM profiles for 1-click hardening.
3. **Multi-Platform Support:** Expanding to Pixel, Stock Android, and iOS tracking protocols.
4. **Field Testing:** Real-world battery and beacon frequency benchmarking.
